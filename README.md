### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm universally known as `Frankie`, a long-time Debian Developer and FLOSS activist. 
I found my way into the free/open-source world in the mid-90s, thanks to my job and experiences after my degree in Computer Science.
Currently, I'm mainly interested in geospatial technologies and methodologies in the context of remote sensing, but as many early geeks
I have extensive experience in system administration and general computing, HPC, and other fields of ICT.
